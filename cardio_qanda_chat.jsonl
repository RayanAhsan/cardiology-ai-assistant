The recommendation statements and grades are followed by the rationale text summarizing the key points of the evidence base and the judgments supporting the recommendation. In relevant sections, considerations of the guideline statements in international settings and suggested audit criteria are also provided where applicable. Important key points and research recommendations suggesting future research to resolve current uncertainties are also outlined at the conclusion of each chapter.</s>"}
